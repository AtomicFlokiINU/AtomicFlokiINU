Atomicfloki WHITEPAPER (available in PDF on the website)


About AtomicFlokiINU!

Atomic Floki Inu is a next generation yield-generating contract on the 
Binance Smart Chain (BSC). All Atomic Floki Inu holders will receive 
BUSD rewards, the distribution is based on volume and current holding 
percentage. BUSD has been chosen as it is stable and not as volatile as other 
alt coins, this leads to every investor having a stable income on the side just 
by holding.

The token contract employs a static reward system and with the Atomic 
Floki Inu team performing manual buybacks as required.
11% of every transaction is split into three

-2% BUSD Reward is distributed to holders. The contract will 
automatically distribute every 60 minutes, however manual claiming can be 
completed if you wish to receive this in shorter time-frames
-5% Allocated in BNB to fund the project marketing wallet, include the 
buybacks and burn
-4% is used to fuel growth in the liquidity pool.
-1% - Development and Team

Sell tax will be 16% spread evenly across the above.
Max transaction will be 1% to limit dumps, with a max wallet of 2% to 
limit large whales.
The team will communicate any changes in the above tokenomics.


FUTURE PLANS

The team at Atomic Floki Inu will be continually developing their use case, 
an initial play to earn game on the website will be further developed, with 
merchandise stores and a potential NFT marketplace further along the 
roadmap.

The initial play to earn game will be hosted on the website and winnings 
will be either in BUSD/BNB or Atomic Floki Inu tokens. 
The play to earn game will be favorable to holders, with the total % of 
holdings multiplied by the players game score to achieve their final score 
with a minimum of .05% of tokens needing to be held to be eligible to win.
Long term the team plan to develop AtomicFloki Swap – a PancakeSwap 
style website / Dapp able to be used to purchase not only Atomic Floki Inu, 
but a multitude of tokens on the BSC network. As the project grows, the 
team have plans to launch via the ETH network and implement 
AtomicFloki Swap onto Eth also.

Atomic Floki Inu has a wide range of marketing skills, and will utilize these 
prelaunch and post launch. Various listings will be applied for after launch, 
with a secondary exchange already secured prelaunch.

All influencer shout outs will be hosted within the telegram group, so 
investors can keep track of the present and future plans for marketing.

BEHIND THE SCENES 

Every transaction processes a certain number of holder wallets, depending 
on the transaction size (bigger token transfers can process more, since the 
gas will still be proportionally less than the value of the tokens) The token is 
based on a Dividend-Paying Token Standard, which means all BUSD the 
contract gains will be split equally proportionally to the holders percentage. 
When a holder wallet is processed, the contract checks how many 
withdraw-able dividends they have, and if it is above the minimum 
threshold for auto-claims, it will send the rewards to that wallet address. 
Holders may also choose to interact with the contract (buy one token) to 
increase the frequency of their pay-out.

This system is fully automated and uses minimal gas fees proportional to 
value transferred. The number of holders processed through each 
transaction is dynamic and based on transaction size. Holders will receive 
dividends from the queue based on their position in the array. It’s a fair 
system, fully automated.

Within the chart, investors will see a sale accompanied by a secondary sale 
(when the swap amount for the contract is met), this is the contract selling 
the taxed tokens to BNB / BUSD and distributing to the LP, Marketing and 
Rewards.

The team will communicate any changes to the above, and if needed will 
limit the amount the contract sells to keep a healthy chart.
